# Functions (Methods)

## The difference between "Function" and "Method"

Technically, a **method** is a function that is within a class.

A **function** doesn't have to be internal to a class (this is possible in C++).

## Function

Note: Method is the common term for Java, while Function is the term used for C++. In some languages it is also known as a sub-routine.

A method is a chunk of code that can be called by its method name. Code is usually stored in a method so that it can be reused throughout the program without copying down the same code.

A method in Java, C++, and C# require a **return-type**, 
a **parameter list**, and the **method body**. The parameter list may be empty.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><pre>public</pre></td>
        <td><pre>int</pre></td>
        <td><pre>sum</pre></td>
        <td><pre>(int a, int b)</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accessibility</td>
        <td>return-type</td>
        <td>method name</td>
        <td>parameter list</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Function Header / Function Signature

The method header is the first line of a function,
which defines the expected **inputs** of a function, 
and the type of **output** it will return, if any.

## Accessibility

Member methods and variables can be qualified with an accessibility level: public, protected, or private.

* A **public** member is available to any other classes anywhere outside of the class it belongs to.
* A **protected** member is only available to the class it belongs to, and any children classes (subclasses).
* A **private** member is only available to the class it belongs to – no child classes.

If no accessibility level is specified, methods and variables are private by default.

## Return Type

The return-type is a required part of a method signature. 
It can be any data-type, such as a **primitive** (int, boolean, double, etc.), 
an **Object** (String, Integer, a class that you specify, etc.), 
or **void** if no return statement is required.

## Function Name

The method name is user defined and used to identify the method. It has to follow the same naming rules as variables: It can contain letters and numbers and underscores, but no numbers as the first character of the method name.

## Parameter List

The parameter list is a list of **inputs** that the method expects to receive when it is called. The parameter list is contained within the parenthesis ( ) of a method signature. It can be empty if no input is required, or contain multiple variables, separated by a comma.

These variables declared in the parameter list may be used anywhere within the method itself, but is not available outside of the method.

## Parameter

A parameter is a variable input that a method uses. It is specified in the **method definition**.

## Argument

An argument is the value or variable passed into a method during the **method call**.

## Function Body / Function Definition

The method body is the code within the curly braces { } after the method header. It is the code that is executed when the method is called.

## Function Declaration

In C++, you may **declare** a function without **defining** it in the same line.

The delaration is only the function header, with a semi-colon at the end.

## Function Call

A method is called by using the method's name and passing in arguments. If the method has a return type, you should store the result in a variable at the calling level, otherwise the data will be lost.

## Function Declaration vs. Function Definition vs. Function Call

Make sure you can tell the difference between these!
